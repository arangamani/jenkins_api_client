# through this API client.

# The IP address of the Jenkins CI Server

:server_ip: 0.0.0.0

# The port number on which the Jenkins listens on. The default is 8080

# If there is a web server routing your Jenkins requests you might need this

:jenkins_path: ""

# The username and password to authenticate to the server

:username: my_username

:password: my_password

# The priviate key file for Jenkins CLI authentication
# remember to upload the public key to http://#{server_ip}:#{server_port}/user/#{my_username}/configure
